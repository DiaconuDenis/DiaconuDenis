# Diaconu Denis Gabriel

A passionate fourth-year student at UNSTPB in Romania, driven by cybersecurity and machine learning, with a strong interest in developing integrated solutions for security challenges.

## About Me

Endurance and discipline shape my approach to both technology and running. Iâ€™m not the fastest, but I show up, stay consistent, and keep learning. I believe that progress over time beats raw talent. Passionate about Machine Learning and Cybersecurity, I like tackling complex problems by doing, not just reading. Always looking to grow, take on new challenges, and keep improving a little bit every day.
